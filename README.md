The following problem statement was given for the selection processs of kritika IIT-B summer projects 2023

The problem statement is given in [Problem_Statement.ipynb](Problem_Statement.ipynb) (which you can view directly in the browser) and the relevant data set is given in [darkmatter.csv](darkmatter.csv). <br>

Based on the problem description, the task is to estimate the amount of dark matter in the halo of a distant galaxy called KriGal. Galaxies follow a well-modelled distribution of stars and their masses as a function of distance from the galaxy centre. These together create a gravitational potential of the galaxy in which the stars revolve. However, observed stellar revolution rates are in stark disagreement with calculated values. This discrepancy can be attributed to the presence of dark matter halo around the galaxy, which creates a potential that fits with the observed velocities.
